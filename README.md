### Hello / Hola

My name is Adrián. I'm an urban designer and architect diving into data analysis.

I'm interested in the intersections between design, technology and infrastructure, and how they affect how we build cities.

Feel free to contact me at [adrianlb@design.upenn.edu](mailto:adrianlb@design.upenn.edu) or [golete@gmail.com](mailto:golete@gmail.com).
Or visit my [website](https://www.adrianleon.xyz/).
